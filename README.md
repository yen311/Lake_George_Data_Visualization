# Lake_George_Data_Visualization
This project is a simple data visualization and modelling for Lake George.
<br />
The data is from 1990-2018. Provide by Bureau of Meteorology, Digital Eearth Australia, and the CSIRO.
<br />
There are five main parts:
<br />1. Reading Lake George's data from the csv file.
<br />2. Caculating some significant characteristics of the lake. (Such as the average vloume, which month is hottest, etc.)
<br />3. Visual lake's areas and volumes. Anaylyzed some intersting points showing on the plot.
<br />4. Modeling Lake George with two model. One is the simple one which only consider the evaporation rate. Another is the complex model which will take more parameters, such as temperature, solar exposure, etc.
<br />5. Evaluate which model will be more accurate in the real world.
<br />
<br /> In the answers.pdf file is my opinion and assumption. I have brefily explain my thought and ideas.
